## ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

### Critical for Production
1. **Email Backend** - Currently using console backend
   - Need to configure SMTP or email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
   - Update settings: `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, etc.

2. **AWS S3 for Media Files** - Environment variables exist but not wired
   - Media files will be lost on Render (ephemeral filesystem)
   - Need to add django-storages and configure S3
   - Update `.env` with real AWS credentials

3. **Database Backups** - No automated backup strategy
   - Render provides point-in-time recovery
   - Consider additional backup solution

4. **Monitoring & Logging** - Basic logging only
   - Consider Sentry for error tracking
   - Consider application monitoring (New Relic, DataDog)

5. **Legal Documents** - Templates exist but need actual content
   - Terms of Service needs legal review
   - Privacy Policy needs to be written
   - Refund Policy needs business rules
   - Content Policy needs guidelines

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Celery for Background Tasks**
   - Settings file exists (`config/settings/celery.py`)
   - Not currently configured or used
   - Would help with email sending, webhooks, report generation

2. **reCAPTCHA** - Configured but disabled
   - Enable in production to prevent spam
   - Already integrated in forms

3. **Testing**
   - Test files exist but appear empty
   - Need unit tests for critical paths
   - Integration tests for checkout flow

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation (if exposing APIs)
   - Developer setup guide (now complete in README)
   - Deployment runbook

5. **Performance**
   - Database query optimization (add select_related/prefetch_related)
   - Caching strategy (Redis for sessions, views)
   - CDN for static assets

6. **Security Enhancements**
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints (throttle.py exists but check coverage)
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Activity logging for admin actions

## 📋 CHECKLIST FOR LAUNCH

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Write/review all legal documents
- [ ] Configure production email backend
- [ ] Set up AWS S3 for media storage
- [ ] Add error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Enable reCAPTCHA
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] SSL certificate (handled by Render)
- [ ] Test Stripe webhooks in production
- [ ] Test full checkout flow
- [ ] Test seller onboarding flow
- [ ] Test refund flow
- [ ] Review all environment variables
- [ ] Change SECRET_KEY to production value
- [ ] Switch to Stripe live keys (not test keys)
- [ ] Set DEBUG=False
- [ ] Test error pages (404, 500)
- [ ] Load test critical paths
- [ ] Security audit (OWASP checklist)

### Post-Launch
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Set up alerts for errors
- [ ] Document incident response process
- [ ] Plan for scaling (if needed)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Regular dependency updates

## 🔐 SECURITY AUDIT

### ✅ Good Security Practices
- HTTPS enforced in production
- HSTS enabled (1 year)
- Secure cookies in production
- CSRF protection enabled
- XSS filter enabled
- X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- .env file in .gitignore
- User passwords properly hashed
- SQL injection protected (Django ORM)

### ⚠️ Security Concerns
- Using live Stripe keys in `.env` file (should use test keys for development)
- No rate limiting on public endpoints
- No account lockout after failed login attempts
- No password complexity requirements enforced
- No email verification on registration

## 📊 CODE QUALITY

### Strengths
- Clean project structure
- Good separation of concerns
- Type hints used (`from __future__ import annotations`)
- Consistent naming conventions
- Proper use of Django best practices
- Model indexes defined
- Signals properly connected

### Areas for Improvement
- Add docstrings to complex functions
- Add type hints to all functions
- Reduce code duplication (DRY principle)
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Improve test coverage

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READINESS

### Render Configuration
- ✅ requirements.txt complete
- ✅ Gunicorn configured
- ✅ WhiteNoise for static files
- ✅ Settings split for environments
- ✅ Environment variables documented
- ⚠️ Need S3 for media files
- ⚠️ Need production email backend

### Database Migrations
- ✅ Migration files gitignored (correct practice)
- ⚠️ Need to run migrations on first deploy
- ⚠️ Consider migration rollback strategy

## 💰 COST CONSIDERATIONS

### Current Stack
- Render PostgreSQL: ~$7-$20/month (depending on plan)
- Render Web Service: ~$7-$25/month
- AWS S3: ~$0.023/GB/month + transfer costs
- Stripe fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction + Connect fees

### Potential Additions
- Email service (SendGrid, AWS SES): ~$0-$20/month
- Sentry: ~$0-$26/month
- CDN (CloudFlare): Free tier available

## 🎯 OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Your application is well-structured and nearly production-ready!**

### Ready to Deploy (with caveats):
- Core functionality is complete
- Security basics are in place
- Stripe integration is working
- User flows are implemented

### Must Do Before Launch:
1. Write legal documents
2. Configure S3 for media
3. Set up production email
4. Switch to Stripe live keys (when ready)
5. Test thoroughly

### Nice to Have:
- Monitoring and logging
- Celery for background tasks
- Comprehensive tests
- Performance optimizations

## 📝 RECOMMENDATION

**You can deploy to staging immediately** to test the full flow in a production-like environment. Before going live with real customers:

1. Complete the legal documents (highest priority)
2. Configure media storage (S3)
3. Test the complete user journey multiple times
4. Have someone else test as well

Your anxiety is understandable, but your codebase is solid. The main gaps are operational (email, media storage) rather than fundamental flaws in the application logic.

- Legal document templates?
- S3 configuration?
- Email backend setup?
- Deployment checklist?

## 2026-02-17 — Comprehensive Sweep Notes (Pack CA)

### Fixed during sweep
- Orders admin aggregation: removed invalid DB annotation using `items__unit_price_cents` (property) and switched to snapshot-safe `Sum(items__line_total_cents)`.
- Appointment deposit order: updated `OrderItem` creation to use snapshot-safe fields and marketplace rounding.

### High-signal risks found (recommend addressing)
- **URL-name drift**: multiple recent runtime errors were caused by stale `url` names/fields in templates/admin queries. Recommendation: keep `rc_check` as a hard gate and add a `urls_check` that attempts reversing key named routes.
- **Snapshot vs property confusion**: anything used in queryset filters/annotations must be snapshot fields (`*_snapshot`), not Python properties. Recommendation: add a short “DB-safe fields” note to DECISIONS and enforce via grep in RC checklist.
